## Data Viz Summary
![Redlining Map](https://github.com/info201a-su23/assignment-01-PagnaKeo/assets/137957363/ecb3c759-8b78-4142-baf4-e16524e70d20)
This is a map of the redlining communities in Detroit in 1939, where the colored-in area indicated the type of risk that would be involved if a person belonged to that area of the city. Due to housing discrimination and other systematic issues in the past, we forced people of color into certain areas of the city. While whites were able to live wherever they wished. With this information, banks and loan offices traced the area in which blacks and other people of color lived, indicating the areas that had a "risk", in terms of loaning out money to them or the likeliness that they will pay back their loans. This led to discriminating against people of color and ultimately segregating colored people from whites. This was their way of evaluating risk back days, as stated in the text 
>"These high-tech, scalable “solutions” were deployed across the nation, and they were one method among many that worked to ensure that wealth remained attached to the racial category of whiteness. At the same time that these maps were being made, the insurance industry, for example, was implementing similar data-driven methods for granting (or denying) policies to customers based on their demographics."

This visualized map was used to help companies determine people's demographic based on where they lived and was used to determine whether or not the person would be granted policies the company offered. This led to massive inequalities among people of color and created a system in which people of power were able to influence the changes in the city.

## Data Viz Bibliography
- **Who or what institution produced the visualization?**

The visualization was created by three teams from 4 universities, led by Robert K. Nelson 
- **When was it produced?**

It was produced and published in 1939
- **Who is the audience for the visualization?**

The audience is the public, the visualization is meant to info the public about inequalities that occur in the past and how they affect those people for years to come
- **How might the visualization be interpreted or misinterpreted? What consequences might this interpretation/misinterpretation have?**

From the picture, you can interpret a few things, such as where they had people located geographically in terms of the redlining areas within Detroit and how they were sectioned off. From another perspective, white people may see it as a  place to avoid or avoid living due to the communities surrounding the area, banks can interpret it as an area where they shouldn't do business with people living in those areas as it may put their business at risk. How someone interprets it is based on their ideology, and how they may want to use the information provided and make something out of it. 
- **How, if at all, does the data visualization represent power or systems?**

I would say it represents power and a system in the sense of what people do with it. People of power who have influence over things with a certain ideology push to maintain wealth within the white community and do this by rejecting others outside that community, manipulating the system and changes that occur. The power can be shown from the communities or redlined areas of the map, without power you can't control what people do or where they live, but when you have the ability to manipulate the system and force people into a certain area, that is power. The system part is the laws that govern and control these actions because, without the right to do something like this, it would never occur in the first place. We know this because the laws that were implemented into the system back in the early days were created to benefit a particular group of people over others, such as segregation and Jim Crow Laws, with a little bit of context we can see how the system and power was used to manipulate certain groups of people.
